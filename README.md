# ZipHub

## Version Control System (VCS)

A version control system (VCS) implemented in C# using Entity Framework Core. The system supports users, repositories, branches, versions (commits), and merges.

## Why "ZipHub"?

A zipper is a perfect metaphor for a version control system (VCS). Just like a zipper connects two sides into a unified line, ZipHub merges code changes into a cohesive whole. It also allows you to "unzip," revisiting previous versions when needed. 

ZipHub represents the seamless merging of individual contributions, offering flexibility, control, and the ability to track and manage your project's evolution.
